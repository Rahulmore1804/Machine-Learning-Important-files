# Therefore, our model predicts that the salary of an employee with 12 years of experience is $ 138967,5.
# **Important note:** Notice that the value of the feature (12 years) was input in a double pair of square brackets. 
# That's because the "predict" method always expects a 2D array as the format of its inputs. 
# And putting 12 into a double pair of square brackets makes the input exactly a 2D array. Simply put:
# 12  {scalar}
# [12]  {1D array}
# [[12]] {2D array}

# [9345.94244312]

# Therefore, the equation of our simple linear regression model is:
# Salary=9345.94Ã—YearsExperience+26816.19 
# Important Note: To get these coefficients we called the "coef_" and "intercept_" attributes from our regressor object.
#  Attributes in Python are different than methods and usually return a simple value or an array of values.
